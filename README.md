Honeypot

    (Done)
    Fake Login System:

        Implement a fake login page that logs all attempted username/password combinations.

        Respond with convincing error messages for failed logins.
    (Done)
    Simulated Vulnerabilities:

        Create endpoints that appear vulnerable to common attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

        Log all attempts to exploit these "vulnerabilities".

    (Done)
    File Upload Trap:

        Add a file upload feature that accepts and logs all uploaded files without actually storing them.

        This can help capture potential malware samples.
    (Done)
    Command Injection Simulator:

        Create an endpoint that appears to allow command injection.

        Log all attempted commands without actually executing them.

    Delayed Responses:

        Implement artificial delays in responses to slow down automated scanning tools.

    Banner Grabbing:

        Provide fake server information in response headers to mislead attackers about your system.

    Session Tracking:

        Implement session tracking to monitor attacker behavior across multiple requests.

    Geolocation Logging:

        Log the geographical origin of incoming requests.

    User-Agent Analysis:

        Log and analyze User-Agent strings to identify potential attack tools.

    Honeytokens:

        Place fake sensitive data (like API keys) in easily discoverable locations and monitor their usage.

    Dynamic Content Generation:

        Generate fake dynamic content to make the honeypot appear more like a real application.

    Rate Limiting with Logging:

        Implement rate limiting and log when limits are exceeded, which could indicate automated attacks.

    Fake Admin Panel:

        Create a fake admin panel that logs all access attempts.

    API Endpoint Mimicry:

        Mimic common API endpoints (e.g., /api/users) and log interactions with them.

    SSL/TLS Downgrade Logging:

        Log attempts to downgrade SSL/TLS connections.
